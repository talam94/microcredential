   <p class="louvText="title="https://www.livescience.com/31935-louvre-museum.html"> Thanks to Architect I.M. Pei, we get to explore this dazzling beauty called the Grand Louvre. He designed this glass pyramid in the courtyard in 1983. Inside the pyramid there is an underground lobby
     where vistor can see the most impressive art collections in the world. The most famous, renowned paintings we all know of is the Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardi Da Vinci, has been sitting there since 1797. The Louvre was actually built as a fortress
     in 1190 and has been rebuilt over the years by Monarchs and today it is about 60,600 square meters. In 1682, Louis XIV moved the royal residence to the Versailes, leaving the Louvre behind as the home for art academics.
     In 1793 Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette were actually imprisoned and beheaded in Tuilleries Palace which was adjacent to the Louvre. In 1802, Napoleon Bonaparte loved the museum so much that he collected.
     art collections from all over the world, changing the name to the Napolean museum. Eventually, the treaty of Fontainebleau made him return 5000 artworks to their original countries in 1815, making the Louvre revert to its original name.
     Its fascinating to know how much history there was behind the Louvre, but it would feel even more captivating when you actually step foot into the building itself and experience the Renaissance realm and French Classical styles.

  <p class="operaText"> The Palais Garnier Opera House is one of the most famous buildings in Paris.
  It is named after Charles Garnier, a young architect who won the competition
  for best design of the building in 1860. The Palais Garnier was completed in 1874 and today is considered a masterpiece of Neo-Baroque Architecture and one of the most beautiful places to visit in Paris.
  He borrowed many historical sources and combined masterfully the colors and textures offered by different kinds of marble and stones,
  porphyry, gilded bronze, iron framework, and other materials. The Grand Escalier (Grand staircase), The Auditorium and The Foyer is a must-see in the Opera Garnier. Great place
  to take pictures and enjoy classical and contemporary ballets. The Garnier House can seat up to 1,979 people making it the world's largest Opera theaters. The theater is big enough to fit the famous Arc de Triomphe!

  <img src="images/arc.jpg" alt="image of Arc de triomphe" class="arcImg">
  <p class="arcText">This extraordinary arc took 30 years (1806-1836) to build and was commissioned by Napolean Bonaparte, who sadly
    passed away before seeing the completed arc. It is inspired by ancient Roman Architecture and was designed by Jean-François-Thérèse Chalgrin
    The purpose of the Arc was to celebrate the memorial victories of the French army.
    It sits in a circular plaza from which 12 grand (including the 'world's most beautiful avenues,'the Champs-Élysées) avenues radiate, forming a star (étoile), which is why it is also called Arch of Triumph of the Star.
